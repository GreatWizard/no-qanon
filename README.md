## How to contribute

Clone this repository and add new domains in the appropriate `.txt` files in the `sources` folder. If you do not want to categorize, just put it in the `sources/default.txt` file and it will be blocked.

> For the `https://www.example.com` website, add `example.com` to the `sources/default.txt` file.

Then, when you push your changes to the `sources` folder, GitHub actions should kick in and automatically generate new versions of the blocklists. Should you want to generate them yourself, you can run the `scripts/update.sh` script (prerequisites : bash, python, git).

Finally, make a pull request: we'll review and approve it within a few days.

### Categorization

Blocked sites are organized using subfolders and `.txt` files in the `sources` folder. Use markdown (`.md`) files and comments (`#`) to add more information and references.

### How to contribute (easy mode)

If you have no idea how Git works, you can still contribute! Just open an issue with the URLs you would like to add to the list, grouping them by language and categories if possible. We'll check and add them shortly.
